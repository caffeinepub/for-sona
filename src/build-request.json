      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "A sanitized copy of the uploaded image exists under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and is loadable directly via `/assets/generated/<sanitized-filename>.png`.",
        "`frontend/src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx` references the new sanitized PNG path for the main hero image instead of `/assets/generated/cute-hero-photo-v2.dim_1600x2000.jpg`.",
        "The hero image renders successfully in the Hero section without triggering the \"Photo coming soon\" fallback when the asset is present.",
        "If the new hero image fails to load (e.g., missing file), the existing fallback UI still appears as before."

  "constraints": [
    "Do not serve images via the backend; all images must be static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and referenced via `/assets/generated/...`.",
