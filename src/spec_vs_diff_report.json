  "summary": "HeroSection was updated to reference the new cartoony hero image filename and retains the existing fallback-on-error behavior. However, the actual new static asset file was not added in the diff summary. There are also unrelated modifications to metadata/summary files not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Add a new more cartoony cute hero image as a static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with the exact filename `cute-hero-photo-cartoony.dim_1600x2000.jpg`, accessible via `/assets/generated/...` without relying on the backend.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added files, and there is no evidence that `frontend/public/assets/generated/cute-hero-photo-cartoony.dim_1600x2000.jpg` was added to the repository. Without the static asset, the browser would 404 and the component would fall back to the placeholder.",
