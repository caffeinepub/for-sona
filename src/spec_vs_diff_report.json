  "summary": "REQ-47 appears partially implemented (the results-card sticker image src is updated), but REQ-46 is not implemented because no new static asset file was added. Due to truncation, it cannot be confirmed that the question-card sticker <img> src was also updated.",

      "requirement": "Add the user-uploaded sticker image file to `frontend/public/assets/generated/` using a sanitized filename and ensure it is loadable at `/assets/generated/<sanitized-filename>.jpg`.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `Added: 0` and explicitly lists no added files, so the required image asset file does not appear to have been added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`.",

      "requirement": "Update `frontend/src/components/sections/QuizSection.tsx` so both corner sticker `<img>` elements (question card and results card) use the real sanitized asset path under `/assets/generated/`.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt confirms the results view uses `/assets/generated/kawaii-valentines-stickers-1.jpg`, but the question-card portion of the file is truncated, so there is no direct evidence that the question-card `<img>` src was also updated.",
