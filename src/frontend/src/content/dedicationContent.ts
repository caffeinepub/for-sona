Thank you for understanding. Thank you for being you. You are so much more to me than you could imagine, But if nothing else I am grateful that I could experience such a heartfelt friendship with someone who I thought I never would. You make people happy and that is your charm, never lose it. I wish to say so much more but as always I find it difficult to say the things I wish to say. I hope this is just the beginning of our journey. If you ever feel sad just look at this page. I promise to keep adding to it.",
